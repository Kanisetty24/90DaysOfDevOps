Any application that is built should be delivered to the customer in an efficient and reliable way.

To achieve this, companies follow a set of standard steps during development and delivery. These include:

    ✅ Unit Testing

    🧹 Static Code Analysis

    📊 Code Quality Checks

    🔐 Vulnerability Testing

    🧪 Functional Testing

    📈 Reports Generation

    🚀 Deployment

🔧 What is CI/CD?

The process of automating these steps is called CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment).
🔍 Breakdown of CI/CD Pipeline Steps
✅ Unit Testing

Testing individual parts of the application.
Example: If a login feature is developed, testing just that logic is called unit testing.
🧹 Static Code Analysis

Checks whether the code is syntactically correct.
It looks for indentation issues, unused variables, etc.
📊 Code Quality

Evaluates if the code is easy to understand, maintain, and modify—without breaking existing functionality.
🔐 Vulnerability Testing

Scans the code for weak spots that hackers might exploit.
🧪 Functional Testing

Verifies that new features do not break existing ones.
Example: Ensure login still works after adding a new feature.
📈 Reports

Summarize test results, issues found, and overall software performance—helping communicate with stakeholders.
🚀 Deployment

If all tests pass, the application is pushed to production.

    📝 Note: These steps may vary depending on the company, application type, and product.

🤖 What is Jenkins and Why is it Used?

Jenkins is an open-source automation tool used for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment/Delivery.

It automates:

    🏗️ Building

    🧪 Testing

    🚀 Deploying software

Benefits of Jenkins:

    🙌 Reduces manual effort

    ⚡ Speeds up delivery

    🔗 Integrates seamlessly with tools

    🐞 Detects issues early

    📈 Improves scalability

    🤝 Enhances collaboration

🔄 What is Continuous Integration?

Continuous Integration (CI) is the process of automating code merges into a shared code base (like GitHub 🐙) and testing them immediately ✅.

Why it’s important:

    🐞 Detects bugs early with frequent testing

    👨‍💻👩‍💻 Enables multiple developers to work on the same project smoothly

    🔁 Reduces manual testing and gives quick feedback

🚚 What is Continuous Delivery vs Deployment?

Continuous Delivery (CD) automates the deployment process 📦.
🕹️ Continuous Delivery

    Code is automatically tested and prepared for production

    Manual approval or trigger is needed for actual deployment 🛑

⚙️ Continuous Deployment

    Code that passes tests is automatically made live in production 🌐

🕒 Why Manual Trigger Helps

    ⏰ Teams can decide the best time to release, avoiding disruptions

    ✅ Provides one last approval step to catch any unexpected issues

🤔 Which One Should You Choose?
✅ Choose Continuous Delivery when:

    You want to manually approve before going live 🛑

    You prefer control over release timing ⏰

    You want to reduce risk 🔐

⚙️ Choose Continuous Deployment when:

    You want automatic go-live after passing tests 🚀

    You need faster updates 🔁

    Your test coverage is strong and reliable ✅
